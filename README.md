Overview

I developed an advanced intelligent system for validating personal names, powered by a custom-trained GPT-4 AI model specifically tailored for this task. The system evaluates user-provided names and assigns a numerical score ranging from 0 to 100, indicating the likelihood that the name is real or fake.

Features

Name Scoring: Each submitted name is analyzed, and a numerical score is generated based on its authenticity.

Detailed Explanation: The system provides a comprehensive justification for each evaluation.

User-Friendly Feedback: A simplified message helps end-users understand why their name might be rejected, enhancing transparency and user experience.

Verification Process:

If the name passes validation with a sufficiently high score, the user can proceed with registration and login.

If the score is low or flagged as potentially fake, the system prompts the user to submit official identification for verification, ensuring fairness and trust.

Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

Reduce fake or suspicious accounts.

Improve data quality across digital platforms.

Enhance system reliability and user trust.

Benefits for Developers

AI-driven validation reduces fraudulent registrations.

Provides detailed insights into the integrity of user-submitted data.

Easily integrable as a validation layer for websites and applications.

How It Works

User submits a name during registration.

The GPT-4 AI model analyzes the name.

A score (0–100) and detailed explanation are generated.

Based on the score:

High score: Registration proceeds normally.

Low score: Identity verification is required before account creation.

Technologies Used

GPT-4 Custom Model – for intelligent name validation.

C# / .NET – backend logic and API integration.

Newtonsoft.Json – handling JSON responses.

Optional: Integration with web platforms or applications for real-time validation.

Future Improvements

Support for multiple languages and cultural name variations.

Continuous model retraining with verified user data for improved accuracy.

Dashboard for developers to monitor suspicious or fake account trends.
